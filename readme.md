# PDEs

This is a collection of notes on Partial Differential Equations and
Distribution Theory based off of my experience in
[Math 6190](http://www.math.cornell.edu/m/Courses/GradCourses/fa13/6190)
with Prof. Tim Healey as well as the books by
[Evans](http://www.amazon.com/Partial-Differential-Equations-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0821849743),
[Stein and Shakarchi](http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Analysis-Introduction-Princeton-Lectures/dp/0691113874/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401481850&sr=1-3&keywords=stein+and+shakarchi),
[Strauss](http://www.amazon.com/Partial-Differential-Equations-An-Introduction/dp/0470054565) and
[Strichartz](http://www.amazon.com/dp/9812384308).

## Editing the Notes

These notes are just a transcription of my own notes from class and as
a result there are probably numerous typos or computational
mistakes. If you find a typo feel free to fix it and submit a pull
request. Alternatively, if at any point, the notes are particularly
unclear, feel free to bring up the issue on github.
